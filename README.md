# spdlog-experimentation
This project is for experimenting with the spdlog library (https://github.com/gabime/spdlog).

## Memory Leak Recreation
The goal here is to recreate a memory leak error that appears to be occurring in 0.13.0 when a rotating file sink is used. Once recreated, we will update to a newer version of the library.

## Version
The version of spdlog being used here is 0.13.0 (https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/releases/tag/v0.13.0).
